Use the breadboard appropriately.

Connect the relay gnd(Ground) to the gnd on the Arduino, relay in1 to pin 8 on arduino.
Connect the arduino 5v to the bread board and the DHT senosr aswell, connect the sensor pin to pin 2 and gnd to gnd.

Upload the code to the arduino and the rest will be done for you.
